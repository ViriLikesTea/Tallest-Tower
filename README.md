# Tallest Tower üè∞
Tallest Tower is a text based adventure game in which you attempt to escape from a prison in various ways. 
I created this along side another student as a part of my programming class. Hence why no
further work will be done on this, unless I feel like doing so, which is unlikely.

```

Go to the project directory

```
